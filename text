How would the following MongoDB document be represented in SQL? (Select all that apply.)

{
    “first_name”: “Yae”,
    “last_name”: “Ji”,
    “age”: “30”,
    “birthplace”: “USA”
}

Certainly! Let’s explore how the given MongoDB document would be represented in SQL:

Table Representation:
In SQL, each row within a table corresponds to a BSON document in MongoDB. BSON stands for Binary JSON and serves as a storage format1.
We can create a table named users with columns corresponding to the fields in the MongoDB document:
SQL

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    birthplace VARCHAR(255)
);

The user_id column serves as the primary key.
Inserting Data:
To insert the data from the MongoDB document, we’d use an INSERT INTO statement:
SQL

INSERT INTO users (user_id, first_name, last_name, age, birthplace)
VALUES (1, 'Yae', 'Ji', 30, 'USA');

Querying Data:
To retrieve the user with the first name “Yae,” we’d use a SELECT statement:
SQL

SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name = 'Yae';

Additional Considerations:
In MongoDB, documents can store nested arrays and objects. If your data includes more complex structures, you might need additional tables or a different schema design.
Remember that MongoDB does not rely on SQL; instead, it employs JavaScript as the primary language for document manipulation, which facilitates interaction with the database using a familiar syntax2. However, when translating to SQL, we follow the relational model conventions. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions! 😊🔍📊
